A quick prototype of a reward redemption page using React, Redux, and React-Router.

`npm install` and then `npm start` to get the app running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

The login credentials are "admin" and "password".

The current state of the app includes:
- a login screen with simple validation
- a home page where the user can view their points and redeem for items
- a modal which offers a detail view of each item on the home page
- an error screen
